**Subject: Clarification Questions & Suggestions for Hulatang PPT**

Hi Client,

Thank you for the detailed requirements for the Hulatang promotional PPT. The structure and creative direction are very clear. To ensure the final product perfectly aligns with your vision, I have a few questions regarding some key details:

**1. Visual Assets (Photography & Graphics)**
The requirements emphasize high-quality, appetizing photography and specific design elements like ink-wash painting backgrounds.
*   **Question:** Could you please clarify the source for these visual assets? Do you have a library of licensed photos we can use, or should I source them?
*   **Follow-up:** If I am to source them, is there a budget for stock photography? Are there any preferred stock photo websites (e.g., Getty, Adobe Stock)?
*   **Question:** For the ink-wash style backgrounds, do you have any examples, or should I proceed with creating/selecting assets that fit the "Modern Chinese Chic" theme?

**2. Video for QR Code**
The final slide requires a QR code linking to a dynamic video.
*   **Question:** Does this video already exist? If so, could you please provide the file or a link?
*   **Follow-up:** If the video needs to be created, is this part of the current project scope? If so, could you provide more details on the desired video content, length, and budget?

**3. Bilingual Content (Chinese Translation)**
The PPT needs to be bilingual.
*   **Question:** Will you be providing the Chinese text for all slides, or would you like me to handle the translation from English?
*   **Follow-up:** If I am responsible for the translation, do you have a preference for Simplified or Traditional Chinese? Also, who will be reviewing the translation for cultural and linguistic accuracy?

**4. Brand Guidelines**
To maintain brand consistency, it's helpful to have specific guidelines.
*   **Question:** Do you have any existing brand assets, such as a specific logo, font families, or exact color codes (e.g., hex codes for the "chili red" and "off-white") that must be used?

**My Initial Suggestions:**
*   **Visual Style:** I propose creating a mood board with a few examples of "Modern Chinese Chic" design, color palettes, and photo styles for your approval before I start building the slides. This will ensure we are aligned on the aesthetic direction.
*   **Content Focus:** I will focus on storytelling, weaving the cultural narrative throughout the presentation as requested, using high-impact visuals to tell the story of Hulatang.

Once I have the answers to these questions, I will be ready to begin the creative process.

Looking forward to your feedback!
