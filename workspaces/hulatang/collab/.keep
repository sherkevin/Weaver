  "content": "Hey! I need your help creating a promotional PowerPoint about Hulatang - you know, that amazing spicy Chinese soup? I'm thinking we should make it really appealing to people who've never tried it before. Maybe around 8-10 slides would be perfect - not too long, but enough to get them interested. For the style, I'd love something modern but with traditional Chinese elements mixed in, you know? Like clean layouts but with some classic patterns or colors. We should definitely highlight the key ingredients - those spices and herbs that make it so special - and show how it's made step by step. Oh, and we absolutely need to emphasize that unique spicy-numbing flavor that makes Hulatang stand out! Maybe we could also include a bit about its cultural significance as a breakfast staple. The most important thing is making it look absolutely delicious - we need some mouth-watering photos of the final dish. What do you think? Does this sound like a good direction?",
